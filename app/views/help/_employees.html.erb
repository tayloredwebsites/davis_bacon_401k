<h2 align="center" style="color: red;">Maintain Employees</h2>
<p align="left">
  When first navigating to the "Maintain Employees" you will be displayed a listing of employees,
  that will display 10 employees per page.  See screenshot below:
</p>
<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="left">
  From this page, you may choose to navigate to the next and/or previous 10 employees.
  When you have located the employee you wish to maintain, you will have the choice of editing
  the employee, and the choice of deactivating or reactivating the employee (depending upon activation status).
</p>
<h3 align="center" style="color: red;">Employees - Deactivate</h3>
<p align="left">
  When the "Deactivate" button is pressed, you will receive the following notification:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/emp_deactivated.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  Note that all deactivated employees will be automatically listed after all active employees,
  and will thus be found on the last page(s) of the employee listing:

</p>
<h3 align="center" style="color: red;">Employees - Edit</h3>
<p align="left">
  When you click on the "Edit" button, you will receive a page similar to the folowing screenshot:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/employees_edit.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  This page displays the personal information about the employee, the deactivated flag,
  and a historical listing of benefits packages.  If you have updated
  any personal information or the deactivation flag, then hit the save button to update.
</p>
<p align="left">
  <h3 align="center" style="color: red;">Employee Benefits Packages</h3>
</p>
<p align="left">
  The "Benefits Packages" section is a listing of the history of benefit packages for that
  employee, with the latest package listed first.  It is important that an accurate history
  of the benefit packages for an employee is maintained.  The benefits system is designed so
  that if a benefit package is modified the system will calculate
  the adjustment amounts for each month required and will create a series of pending
  deposits for each relevant month.
</p>
<p align="left">
  When an employee gets a pay raise, or benefits increase
  that is not retroactive, then a new benefits package must be created (do not edit the latest
  one, as that will cause a retroactive adjustment).
</p>
<p align="left">
  In the screen listing above, you will
  notice that one of the entries is deactivated (displayed with slashes through it). If a deposit
  has been made using figures from a particular benefits package, the system will automatically
  create a new benefits package, leaving the original benefits package unmodified.  This is an
  important mechanism to ensure that deposit figures are accurate, as well as maintain
  an audit trail of deposits and changes.  For the same reason, a benefits package will not be
  allowed to be deleted if there are deposits existing for it.
</p>
<h3 align="center" style="color: red;">Employee Packages - Edit</h3>
<p align="left">
  When you click on the "Edit" button for a particular benefits package, you will receive a page similar to the folowing screenshot:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/package_edit.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  After making any changes for an employee package, click the "Save" button to update your changes.
</p>
<h3 align="center" style="color: red;">Employee Packages - Warnings and Errors</h3>
<p align="left">
  If you attempt to create a record that has the same "Current Month" and "Current Year", you will
  not be able to update the record, and will be returned the following error message:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/pkg_update_error_exists.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  When editing an employee package that has benefits already deposited, it will look like any other package
  in the employee edit package listing as in the following screen shot:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/pkg_update_1.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  If any changes are made to a package that has deposits applied against it, you will now see two records for
  the particular month, after saving changes to the package.  The first entry listed for the particular month is the new package for the employee.
  The next entry listed for the month is the original employee package, which has remained unchanged and deactivated.
  The packages for the month will look similar to the following screen shot:
</p>
<p align="left">
  <img border="2" src="/assets/help_screen_shots/pkg_update_2.jpg" alt="Edit Employee"/>
</p>
<p align="left">
  Note: Retroactive changes to an employee's Benefit Package will cause some monthly benefit entries to be out of balance
  (see "Help Maintain Monthly Benefits").  To properly correct the out of balance conditions, each of the benefit entries
  effected will need to be reviewed and updated.  This is required because
  the system is designed so that no dollar amounts will be automatically entered without user involvement.
